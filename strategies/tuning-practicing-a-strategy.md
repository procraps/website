# \*^ Tuning/Practicing a Strategy

### Why

### How: Tuning and Practicing

### 5 Steps to tuning your craps strategy

**1. Identify your per-shooter spread: how much per shooter is going to be required**

* What is the initial and maximum investment per shooter?
* Are you going to re-invest during a roll \(like a forever come bet\)
* This determines your buy-in
  * Follow the rule of 10's

**2. Know what it takes to "get out of the hand"**

* Your "per shooter" spread is your target
* How quickly can you recoup that spread and get into profits
  * How many hits/collects does it take?
* How protected are you while that is taking place?

**3. How quickly can you reach your win goal?**

* Do you have an out plan?

**4. Measure your exposure and risk**

* **Depth:** How much of our bankroll are we exposing?
* **Length:** For how long will it be exposed
* **Width:** How wide or narrow is your coverage \(speaks to length and win potential\)
* **Danger**: What is it exposed to \(The 7, or some hedge\)

**5. Decide how you will handle your profits**

* Racking
* Pressing strategy, if any
* Odds and Lays
* Redistributing your profits
* Regressing

### Testing your strategies

**Test your strategy on a single shooter only.**

* Put only 1 shooters worth of chips in your rack
* Run your strategy with only those chips
* Take notes
  * How many times on average does it win?
  * What's the max, minimum and average win and loss amount \(use percentages\)

**Test the chip movement, given all scenarios**

* Play the "If this, then that" game with every possibility
* Take note of what your expected losses and wins are with every dice combination
* Know where it's strongest and weakest

#### Base Testing a Strategy

* Use and Re-Use the same "golden" set of the most common rolls
  * Multiple Pass Line winners and losers
  * PSO
  * P1O
  * 4 Rolls, No Repeats and a 7
  * 5 Rolls, 2 Repeats and a 7
  * 4 & 5 Rolls with mostly field/horn numbers
  * 10 Rolls, with a couple of horn numbers
  * 20 Rolls, with a couple of horn numbers
  * 36 Rolll with all the magic
* Can your strategy survive \(or even profit\) on an "ugly" roll?
* Does your strategy take advantage of the good rolls?
* Do you have a "go hard" mechanism built in?
* Does your strategy have an exit plan?
* Calculate the EWV \(Expected Win Value\) of your strategy

**Live and Scale Testing**

* Get on your table and roll it out with 100+ hands
* Write a WinCraps script and run it over 100,000 rolls
