# Understanding Exposure

### Why

Craps, like everything in the casino, is a losing proposition. Every roll of the dice has the potential to take some, or all, of your money. When you're planning out or playing a strategy, it's critical that you understand where your exposure is, and how quickly you can cover things up.

### What

Exposure at the craps table comes in 3 major forms:

1. **Depth**: How much of your bankroll is exposed to loss
2. **Breadth**: How many dice combinations beat you 
3. **Length**: How long is your bankroll exposed

#### Depth - Bankroll Exposure

* What percentage of your buy-in is in action?
* Is your action always at risk?
  * i.e. Come Bets vs Place Bets, Hop Bets vs Hardways

#### Breadth - What can beat you

* What do you have covered
* What combinations beat you
* Can you mitigate some or all of them with a hedge
* Does a hedge make sense
  * Long term and short term hedges \(Some are contracts\)
  * When does it financial sense?
    * Hedging a $5 bet is probably=75\*3 silly, but $500?

#### Length - How long are you exposed

* How many wins does it take to "break even" or "get out of the hand"
* How many rolls do nothing for you
* Do you have enough coverage
  * Will you be there forever waiting for your $30 6 to hit?

### How

* Know the payouts
* Know the probabilities
* Know the house edge
* Know what hedges what
* Understand all the hops

### Examples

**Hawaiian Horn**

* Depth: Very Deep \($310\)
* Length: Very Short \(1 Roll\)
* Breadth: 7 is the killer. Non-Horns cost you $20, feeding the edge.

**Iron Cross**

* Depth: Varies \($100\)
* Length: Medium-High \(5 hits to break even, if only collecting\)
* Breadth: 7 is the killer. Non-Horns cost you $20, feeding the edge.

**6 & 8**

* Depth: Varies \($24\)
* Length: High \(10/36 ways to collect, need 2 to break even\)
* Breadth: 7 is the killer \(6 rolls\), Everything else \(20 rolls\) is non-productive

**Inside**

* Depth: Varies \($44\)
* Length: Medium \(18/36 ways to collect, need 4 to break even\)
* Breadth: 7 is the killer \(6 rolls\), Everything else \(12 rolls\) is non-productive

**Hops**

* Depth: Generally Small \($2\)
* Length: Short \(1 Roll\)
* Breadth: Only 2 or 3 ways to win out of 36
* Compare this to placing
  * On a hop 5, you have 4 ways to win \(9/36\)
    * 8 rolls lose you $2
    * 1 roll, you win $14, but your net is -$2
  * Vs: Place the 5 for $10
    * The 8 non-productive rolls do not cost you
    * The 1 that wins nets you $14
    * You're exposed to the 7 for all 8 rolls, though
      * If it shows once, you'd lose $10 and net $4 on the hit
