# ^House Money

### Why

"House Money" is the casino's best friend. You may think you've got the advantage when "playing with house money", but do you really?

* House money is EASY to bet with
* Dealers are trained to make "same bet" the default on props and hops
* Dealers are trained to pay you in the unit size that you're betting ... 
* Press it. Press one unit. Press it all the way up. Spread it out.
  * When your winnings look like your bets \(same color\), you won't do the math
  * These are ways for you to burn the money you earned

Imagine yourself with $30 on the 6 and 8, and you take a hit. You might say something like "Give me the 5 for a quarter" or "Make it look like 60" while pocketing a couple of reds. You might even repeat this a few times. Easy, right? As long as you start racking cheques before big red, yes.

Now, imagine that after every roll, you had to pull down all of your bets and re-bet them, like you can in other games. Would you pull down your $60 place bets and your $35, take a drink and then toss the dealer $100 to spread around? It's different when it's actually in your rack, isn't it? And if you're betting at a higher level, that could be even harder to do when you have those chips in your hand.

_**As long as they never hit your rack, the casino sees every cheque on the table as theirs,**_ which is why they make it so easy to spend. They know if you touch it, it may not come back. This is also the reason they rarely pay you in color, even if you ask for it.  If you're a "green" better, you're getting paid in green, never black, because they're in your head. Never forget that.

### What

**"House Money"** is often used to describe playing the game \(craps or any casino game\) with chips you just won. They're not yours, so they must be from "The House" or the casino. Wrong.

**Chips you win are yours.** The minute you win them, they are yours to keep, spend, or re-bet. They no longer belong to "The House"

The casino's LOVE you using the phrase "House Money" ... Why? They know what's coming next, just like you do. And when that seven comes, that money is going right back to the house.

That said. Playing with your winnings, specifically, employing a strategy designed to win with and to put only your new winnings at risk is definitely a "Pro" way to play the game.

Free Betting" is another term for this. Again, nothing at a casino is really free. "Risk Free" might be more on point, as your original bankroll may be no longer at risk, evin your your newfound profits are. But still ...

The phrase "Re-Investing Your Profits" is far more accurate, as this is what you're actually doing. And by noting that you are putting your profits out there, it'll remind you of where the money actually came from, which is your pocket.

### How

Re-invest your profits like a pro. Regardless of the strategy you want to play, we recommend that your first order of business is to fund your strategy, or even up your hand before you get aggressive. Once you're at the point where you've won back what you started with in a hand ... that's the time to employ your strategy and be aggressive. You are at no risk of losing at that point. You are at risk of not turning a profit But thats acceptable as part of a larger strategy.

**Using one strategy to pay for another is a pro way to get to Risk Free play...**

#### Short "So That" Games

* $30 6 and 8, which pays $35, **so that** you can fund a $32 across strategy
* $160 across, where all bets pay $35, **so that** you can fund the Come Ladder \(7 units\)
* Hawaiian Horn for 2 hits which is setup to win $50/roll, **so that** you play "all-in" with $110 across

#### Regression

* Any time you triple\(or more\) your bets _**so that**_ you can go back down to a single unit and build up

Get out of the hand ASAP ... Get that initial investment back into your rack as fast as possible and then you can play hard.

#### Grow, Pull, Spread

* Feeding the 6 and 8 or adding numbers from other hits
* Single Press
* Half Press
* Full Press
* Power Press
* Alternate Press
* Press/Press/Pull

### General Notes

Emotional betting is a profit killer. And it's what the casinos depend on. Remember to manage the money in your rail to protect your profits and to stay on strategy. Don't forget that whenever you tell your dealers to "press it" or "spread it", they're spending **your** money.

The point of profits is to bring money home, not burn it. 

* Do not chase losses
  * Throwing good money after bad is a mistake
* Do not pull from your profits
* Do not make poor decisions \(like hardways\) because you feel like it
