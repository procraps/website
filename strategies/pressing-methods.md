  yes. Let's find the perfect pressing strategy.

# \*^ Pressing Methods

### What

How do we make money in Craps?

1. Get out of the hand ASAP \(get back your initial investment and eliminate risk\)
2. Get money off the table \(collect profit\)

How do we make real money in Craps?

1. Get as much money as we can off the table

The only way to do that, though, is to put more money out there. How can we do that without crushing our bankroll?  

Pressing. Or ... using your profits to increase your bets.

### Why

There are literally hundreds of betting and pressing strategies out there. The YouTube Craps experience is chock full of different ways to press your bets to crush the casino. These range from the simplistic to the insane and almost dangerous. They're all variations of the same basic idea, though, which is to take some or all of your winnings, perhaps adding a little bit more from your bankroll, and increasing your bet sizes. 

That translates to higher payouts, which, if you repeat the process, turns into increasingly higher profits.

Pressing succeeds, though, only when numbers are getting hit repeatedly.  The reality of that happening is pretty low. In fact, after a point has been established:

> 60% of the time, the 4 and 10 are never hit and only 24% of the time are they hit even once. 5 or more times? Less than 1%

> The 5 and 9? 55% never hit. 25% hit once, roughly 8% chance of the 2nd hit, and only a 1.3% chance they get to 5 hits. It goes down from there.

> How about the 6 & 8, the easiest numbers to hit: 52% never getting hit. 24% chance of getting 2 hits, and about 10% of getting that 3rd hit. After that, it drops into the single digits.
