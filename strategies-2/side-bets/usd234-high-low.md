# $234 High Low

Take 30 progressive cracks at either the 2 or the 12, in levels of 3 bets, each level progressing by $1.  So long as you hit your number 1 time out of 36, which is the actual odds, you'll be ok ... if not, hopefully you enjoyed the ride!

| Bet Amount | Worst Case Investment | Win |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $1, $1, $1  | $3 | $30 |
| $2, $2, $2 | $9 | $60 |
| $3, $3, $3 | $18 | $90 |
| $4, $4, $4 | $30 | $120 |
| $5, $5, $5 | $45 | $150 |
| $6, $6, $6 | $63 | $180 |
| $7, $7, $7 | $84 | $210 |
| $8, $8, $8 | $108 | $240 |
| $9, $9, $9 | $135 | $270 |
| $10, $10, $10 | $165 | $300 |
| $11, $11, $11 | $198 | $330 |
| $12, $12, $12 | $234 | $360 |

NOTE: After the $10 level, your returns begin to diminish, as the bet only wins $30 ... putting more than $30 out there to win $30 is silly. 

Don't do that beyond roll 36. 

... Or don't do this at all. It's ridiculous
