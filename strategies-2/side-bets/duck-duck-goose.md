# Duck Duck Goose

Combine the Traveling Lay with the Marching Soldier ... 

Start by laying the point for enough to win table minimum \(i.e. $20 on a $10 table\), and on every roll, move that behind the number that just rolled. Unlike the “real” traveling lay, do not keep increasing the amount, just keep it

Next, put table minimum on either the 4 or the 10. If it wins, stack it up and move the bet to the next number \(i.e. bet on the 4 moves to the 5\) and repeat. This’ll win $1200 for $5 if you get all the way across.

If the 7 comes, the lay bet pays for the soldier, and you live to fight another day.

Dumb, but if you’re trying to burn some time, get some free drinks and maybe hit a jackpot, this could be something to mess with.

Think we should find a cool name for this, something like “Duck Duck Goose” or “Chicken and Egg” or something.
