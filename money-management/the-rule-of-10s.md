# ^ The Rule of 10s

### Why

Craps is not a guarantee. Not a guaranteed win ... and not a guaranteed loss either. 

It's streaky. Wins and losses will come at you in waves.  We want to make sure that our bankroll can withstand losses, perhaps multiple losses in a row, and still be there when the big roll or great session happens, so you can take advantage.

If you burn your bankroll to quickly in the down times, or mismanage it ... chances are you won't be around  when things turn around.

So, we employ a strategy of money management called "The Rule of 10's" to help us weather the storm and be ready to strike when we have the opportunity

### What

The Rule of 10's is very simple: Have enough bankroll to sustain you for 10 "chances" at winning. A chance is either a buy-in at the table \(a "Session"\) or a shooter \(or hand\) at the table during a session.

The idea here is to play up to 10 times, with the end goal being to win some stated percentage for the entirety of your bankroll, be it at the table, or in your account.

#### In your bank account -401\(g\)

You must have enough money in your bank to fund **10 sessions** at the dollar level you play to play each session with.  You can look at funding your play or your 401\(g\) account from either direction.

> If your strategy calls for $120 per shooter: $1,200 per session,  you need $12,000 in your 401\(g\) account
>
> Looking at it the other way ... if your 401\(g\) account has $5,000 in it, work on a $500/session, $50/shooter strategy.

This should allow you to buy in 10 times, putting 1/10th of your overall bankroll at risk each time, with a goal of winning some overall percentage. Only at that percentage, does your per-session amount go up.

> For example, your bankroll is $5,000 and your sessions are $500 each. Assume your win goal is 20%. 
>
> As you win \(or lose\) with each of your 10 sessions, your 401\(g\) account will obviously change. As soon as you've increased it to $6,000 \(20%\), whether that takes 1 session or 9, you can then increase your session limit to $600, and so on.
>
> Having goals and sticking to a plan is crucial.

#### At the table - 1 Session

You must buy in with enough money to fund your strategy for **10 shooters**. 

> In our example, $500 is your session money. In this case, you'll need to come to the table with a strategy that only requires $50 per shooter \(or per hand\) with that win goal of 20%.
>
> $500 might seem like a decent amount to buy in for, but when you break it down to weather a 10 shooter storm, it feels really small at $50/shooter. Avoid the temptation to double up or chase. Trust your strategy to pay off.

As with managing your bank account, you might hit your 20% on the first shooter. It might take you 8 shooters to get on that hot roll that brings you all the way back and then some. This may seem daunting, but if you manage your rack and chips correctly at the rail \(see our video on rack management\), you can extend 10 shooters to 15 or 20 as you build and reallocate profits.

### How

* Don't start playing until you've first got your 401\(g\) in proper order to sustain you
  * In other words, don't take your first $500 and start going after it.
  * Start wtih $1000, and sessions of $100, with a simple growth strategy
  * If you don't, you'll be  burned, quickly
* Set and stick to your win goal
* Do not up your per-session or per-shooter budget until you've hit your win goals
  * Option 1: Set a session bump goal
    * For example, if you're at that $5k level, stay with the $500/session number until you've doubled yourself to $10k ... and only THEN move your session number to $1000
  * Option 2: Dynamic sessions
    * Your per-session limit is always 10% of your current 401\(g\) balance
      * This means your buy-ins may be higher or lower, depending
      * This can make it tough to bring a consistent strategy
* Commit to every "chance" \(session or shooter\) being played with **all-in** mentality. 
  * You're hitting your goal, or you're burning that chance

You can work outward from your bank account, using it to determine how much each session's buy-in will be, and then craft strategy from there.

Or, you can calculate this from the table, and decide first on your per-shooter cost, multiply that by 10 to determine how much you need for each session, and then that by 10 to determine how much you need in your 401\(g\) before you start this process.
