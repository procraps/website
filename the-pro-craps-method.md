# ^The Pro Craps Method

### Why

Let's not make this any easier on the Casinos than we have to. There are plenty of others out there that do that for us. We know:

* The Casinos have the edge on us, even if it's slight, it's constant over time
* There is no such thing as a strategy that's a guaranteed way to win
* In fact, over time, you will lose

This is the nature of gambling. It's inherently a risk. Gambling puts your money at risk, period.

We may not be able to flip the advantage, but we can manage our money and our strategies so that when the averages tilt to our favor, we're physically there, we're properly financed financed, and we're practiced and ready to jump on that opportunity. Most importantly, we'll have the discipline to walk.

Can we flip the advantage? In short bursts, yes. But it's going to take planning, practice and work.

### What

In order to have a chance at long term success, you need to be on your game. All the time.

The 10 Commandments of Playing Like a Pro. 

#### 1. Only gamble with money you can afford to lose

Bring money set aside for the purpose of entertainment

#### 2. Manage your gambling money separately

Create a 401\(g\) account and treat this like a business

* Gas money
* Flight
* Hotels
* Supplies
* And your time at the table

#### 3. Plan everything

Know ahead of time how much you're walking in with, and what you plan to walk out with

If you're playing multiple sessions in a day \(i.e. a Vegas Vacation\), only bring one session's worth of money to the floor with you.

Plan your meals, breaks, and other activities.

#### 4. Track and log everything

Use a spreadsheet or a ledger to track every session. 

* It'll keep you accountable
* It'll give you information
* It'll help you see how you're progressing towards your goals.

#### 5. Set an achievable "Win Goal" and stick to it

Think in terms of percentages, not dollars.

If you're buying in for $300 a 20% goal is $60. If you're at a higher level, add zeroes or other multiples. 

* $2500 = $500 in winnings
* $10,000 = $2000

At the lower bankroll, that might seem silly. What's $60? **It's 20%**

If you reliably had a 20% gain in your stock portfolio or your 401\(k\),  you'd be investigated by the feds. If your house goes up 20% every year, you'd be in great shape.

Why isn't 20% or 25% enough at the casino? It's simple relativism. 

* You've had a few great runs where you've colored up $500 on a $200 buy-in. 
* You can't let go of the fact that $60 is a tangible amount, and isn't enough to fill your gas tank and get a burger on the way home

This is what the casino is counting on. They play the long game, leeching a paltry 2% from you \(on average\) every hour. $2 per hundred is way less than $20, but look at those buildngs and those lights.

Play the long game against them, and don't get sucked into a hot streak or you'l burn your bankroll.

#### 6. Use the "Rule of 10s"

The Rule of 10s gives of 10 chances to make our profit goal. It lets us "survive" the ups and downs of our sessions so that we'll be at the table when the hot roll comes.

It takes a bit of planning and discipline, but sticking to this simple rule will keep you more in touch with with your bankroll. Having 10 cracks at it is a huge stress reliever, as well. You can play a little bit looser, although with maybe a little less active money than you're probably used to.

* Divide your 401\(g\) account into 10 sessions
  * Bring only 1 session out of your 401\(g\) acount to the casino
    * Don't dip into your pocket or your 401\(g\) if you lose it. If you lose, you walk
* At the table, divide your session $ into 10
  * For each of 10 shooters, bet only that amount
    * Do not dip into your profits or your remaining bankroll should you go to zero on a shooter

#### 7. Play for the win by planning for the loss

The Rule of 10s is an all-in strategy. We're planning on using the entire session buy-in to win that 20%. If you were only willing to lose half of it, then only bring half of it, and then play for 5 shooters. 

Bet what you brought, it's the only way to survive the table until it heats up for you and matches up with your strategy.  This holds true for your 401\(g\) account as well. You've got 10 shots in there, plan to use them all to make your goals. 

* Be willing to lose your entire session
* Be willing to lose your entire alotment on any given shooter
* You've budgeted for 10 shooters, use them all
* ... be willing to lose the entire session 
  * Know that you've got more cracks at it in your 401\(g\)

_**BUT: Do not chase your losses!**_

Chasing our gambling losses means using house money \(your actual house's money\). Don't do it.

* Be a machine
* You're going to have bad sessions as well as good
* The 401\(g\) account and the Rule of 10s is designed to withstand periodic loss
* Go home, take your lumps
* **Assess** what happened
* **Address** your weakness or mistakes
* **Adjust** your strategy for next time

#### 9. Develop and Practice Your Strategy\(ies\)

No switching mid-stream, unless you've prepped for a mitigation at the same dollar level and have a solid reason for a switch. There's no such thing as a "cold table" or a "hot shooter" ... the only things you can reliably count on are vetted controlled shooters, maybe yourself, and the actual random probabilities.

It's not a bad idea to have a strategy for you and a strategy for everyone else. Setup your session to account for that.

No random prop or side bets when you're "feeling it" unless you've budgeted for it, or took a win so that you could do it. This is one of the biggest sources of leakage, accounting for the casino's house edge.

#### 9. Practice your throws

Even if you're not a "Dice Controller" or "Influencer" ... even if you think that's impossible ... practice your throws. 

Yes. **Every throw is random.** But some are more random than others, and you can give yourself a far better shot at extending rolls if you develop a soft, consistent shot that doesn't fly all over the board. Contrary to the naysayers ... running your dice off of chip stacks and people's hands does make a scientific difference. The more times a "match" to the landed die shows, the more chances it has to match up. The less violent your throw, the less rotations and skittering you get off the backwall, the better your shot is.

And if you can actually influence the dice, even a little bit, that effect can be pretty drastic.

See our "Truth about Dice Control" and "Respect the 7" videos for more on this.

#### 10. Be a machine

Learn to love discipline in every aspect of the gambling experience, specifically your money. Be an ATM machine ... 

* Application of Strategy
* Knowledge of the game \(payouts, etc\)
* Practice money management
* Recognize when you're done, and actually be done.
* Stick to your core strategies
  * Do not get sucked into hot/cold tables or allow emotion to guide you
* Budget separately for fun
  * Side Bets, Tokes, Drinks
