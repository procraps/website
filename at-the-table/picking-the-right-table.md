  Knowing where is to play is crucial. Picking the loudest table with the lowest
  minimum and an open spot could crush your bankroll. Count the chips, not the
  high fives if you want to color up.

# ^ Picking The Right Table

### Why

Finding the table that matches your session goal and playing style is just as important to winning as is your ability to roll and the perfection of your strategy. If you're at the wrong place at the wrong time, none of it matters.

### What

**Get in touch with what you're planning to do, strategy-wise**. We all want to win, but you need to be in tune with a few basic things before you start looking for a spot.

* What's your general strategy \(right side vs dark side\)?
  * Do you need to be in a specific spot to play/shoot?
* What's your bankroll?
* Who are you with?
* What's your goal \(winning or having fun\)?

### How

#### First, a few Don'ts

#### 1. Ignore the noise

The "vibe" of a table has nothing to do with your ability to win, nor the rolling state of a game. A table that's been cold or choppy for an hour might be celebrating because someone FINALLY made a point. If you're a dark-sider, this might be a great landing spot for you. You may have simply walked up to group of people partying and they're loud just because. 

Evaluate the table on other criteria ... unless high energy bothers you.

... Or, if you're just out to have fun with your friends. Then, by all means jump in, but play to grind it out \(you won't be paying much attention to the game\)

#### 2. Don't let your bankroll deter you from a table

It's pretty easy to discount tables based on the minimum bet. Lower limit tables don't automatically bring in beginners, and higher limit tables aren't filled with professionals.

If you're faced with higher minimums than you'd like but the table fits your other criteria, adjust

* Play for 5 shooters instead of 10
* Work more of a short game
* Transition to a grinding or slow-build strategy to sustain you, and maybe then you can switch it up

If you'd rather play high limit, but all you see is the lower tables, do not assume it's amateur hour. In fact, many of the best players like a low limit table so that they can hit, regress, and build. You'll also find some folks practicing dice control, which, if you know what to look for can be a HUGE advantage.

#### Things to look for

Chart the tables. Simply walking up and dropping your session money down without doing any research at all is suicide. If you want to really chart it, use your phone or a notepad to log the shots, points made and missed. Take special note of the comeouts and number clusters if that's a part of your strategy.

| Player | Points Made | Inside \#s | Outside \#s | Field \#s | Horn \#s | 7s | Roll Length |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 0 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 6 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 3, 6 |
| 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 |

We recommend watching everyone at the table shoot once so you can assess the general direction, their skills, etc.  Here are some of the other things we look for in charting a table:

#### 1. Chips 

Look for a few things with regards to chips to give you a handle on how folks are doing, generally

* **Do most players have a decent number of chips?** 
  * If everyone's rail is down to knuckles, things aren't going so well
    * This is the rallying call for the dark side bettor ... 
* **Color Spread and Color Up**
  * If it's a $5 or $10 table, are you seeing Green? Black?
  * $25 table ... you should be seeing some black
* **Are the racks a mess?**
  * If the money is coming in quick, people tend not to be very neat. Might be a good sign
* **Where is the money?**
  * Most right bettors tend to be by the stick or the hook
    * If the guy next to the stick is loaded, he might be a controlled shooter having a good night
  * Don't betters hang out by the end, near the DC, since it's a self service bet
    * If you see a bunch of scowling old dudes back there with a stack of black ... you can bet that the table is probably on the cold or choppy side. 
    * If you're a dark side player, get in quick before it heats up
    * If not, keep on walking

#### 2. Lots of Openings or a Mass Exodus

If a table has more than 2 openings at a busy time, that's telling you something ...

Its possible that it has just opened up and you'll be one of the first. Your superstitions may keep you away, but in reality, this is an opportunity to get your favorite spot.

If half the table leaves at once, try and assess:

* Are they all going to dinner or a show?
* Did they all just get thwacked?

The go/no-go decision for you here is based on your betting strategy. A bunch of people getting whacked and leaving might seem a good thing for a dark-sider, but if they all leave, who's left to throw you those 7's? 

#### 3. Reliable shooters

If you don't belive in dice control or dice influence, you can probably ignore this ... but you should.

Watch the dice go around and take note of what you're seeing. Here's some things to look for. Be sure and note which of these matches your strategy. You might want a choppy table, so recognize the signs.

* **Crazy Random Throwers**
  * People literally closing their eyes and winging dice all over the place. Horrific. 
  * If your strategy depends on a long roll ... run away. They're just as likely to throw 2 as 42
  * You tend to see a lot more horn numbers and 4's and 10s out of these folks for some reason
  * If you're playing for chop \(i.e. Come or DC Betting\) this might not be a bad opportunity
* **Bad Dice Controllers**
  * Taking **forever** to set the dice, maybe even re-setting them
  * Inconsistent flight patterns \(dice tumbling, wobbling, split way apart, landing and flying\)
  * Inconsistent height, speed, landing zones
  * These folks are likely still practicing and trying to figure it out
  * **They will reliably throw more 7s than a random shooter**
* **Rhythm Throwers**
  * Not dice controllers, but folks that typically pick up the dice and toss them about the same way every time. Soft, landing in the same spot, not a lot of noise.
  * This is still random, but these rollers tend to find a groove or live in the pocket more often than than the random rollers
* **Decent Dice Controllers**
  * Setting the dice quick
  * Consistent height, landing zone and action
  * Dice stick together in the air
  * **They will reliably throw 7's less than the average**. Maybe every 7 or 8 instead of every 6 rolls. They're also more likely to hit the other numbers in clusters.

#### 4. Fun Dealers

Remember, Craps is a fun game. If you see a bunch of stodgy, angry folks that look like they're at the end of a shift, you might think about avoiding the table. 

* It'll lessen your experience
* You're more likely to see mistakes
* You're less likely to get an assist or reminders

### Remember!

There's a lot that goes into winning this game. Choosing a table is just a small part of it

* Choose the right table
* Be a machine
  * Manage your bankroll
  * Manage your chips
  * Set and Stick to your goals
  * Work your strategy
  * Track everything
  * Practice, Practice, Practice!
