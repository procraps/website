  Do you bet the same way regardless of whose got the dice? If you're not
  altering strategy, spread, or aggressiveness based on the toss, you're likely
  missing big opportunities.

# ^ Identifying The Shooters

### Why

Let's get one thing clear: even the best strategy on the best day will eventually lose. Also:

* "The dice have no memory"
* "Every roll is unique"
* "The pyramids make every throw the same amount of random"
* "Dice control is impossible"
* And a bunch of other BS

There are degrees of random, and if you're plugged into it, you can identify and make the right adjustments

### What

Here are the 4 primary shooter types you'll run into and how to spot them.

**Random Throwers**

* What to look for:
  * People literally closing their eyes and winging dice all over the place.
  * Shaking them, blowing on them
  * Throwing them as fast as possible
  * Getting them into and out of their hands way too quickly
  * Be especially wary of partiers, drunks, virgins, and people trying to have a good old time
* What to expect:
  * They're just as likely to throw 2 as 42
  * You tend to see a lot more comeout 7's, horn numbers and outside numbers
  * But they're so random, you can't get into a groove or expect one.
  * That said, if a rando gets past 6 or 7 rolls, look out...
  * Average roll count: Impossible to determine
* How to play them
  * Start with a 3 or a 5 count
  * Come/Don't Come betting series + a small horn is a good way to bet on a rando. 
    * You get some 7/11 protection
    * On a long roll, maybe some repeats for the Come bettor
  * If your strategy **depends** on a long roll ... run away
  * For the Don't bettor, randos can be tough with the craps numbers and aren't bad enough to make consistent 7's ... Maybe lay off the odds

**Bad Dice Controllers**

* What to look for:
  * Taking **forever** to set the dice, maybe even re-setting them multiple times
  * Dice are tumbling instead of rotating
  * Dice are apart \(higher, wider\) or traveling at different speeds
  * Inconsistent height, speed, landing zones
  * Dice scattering after landing
    * This happens when they don't land flat, but on an edge
* What to expect
  * **They will reliably throw more 7s than a random shooter** 
  * If you can see their set ...
    * If it's a hardways set, and they're coming up with 6's and 1's, they're off axis
    * If they're throwing a 3V, and have bad form \(above\) they've got no chance of avoiding the 7
    * In both cases, plan for short rolls and horn numbers
  * These folks are likely still practicing the art of DC/DI and trying to figure it out
  * Average roll count: 3-4 if they're having a decent day
* How to play them
  * Plan for short, choppy rolls
  * Stay off the ATS or any side bets
  * Plan for their hand to  be worse than random
  * For the Do Bettor: Play a 3 or 5 count before going in
  * For the Don't Bettor: This might be what you're looking for
  * A short Come or DC progression generally work pretty well here

**Scared and Superstitious Throwers**

* What to look for
  * Fidgeting with the dice
  * Rolling them against the back wall over and over trying to get a number before they throw
  * Slapping the table
  * Rubbing the dice
  * Doing some routine every time to impart ju-ju on the dice
  * Agitated and anxious
* What to expect
  * All that has nothing to do with how they will actually roll
  * However, their vibe is awful and it sucks the life out of a table
  * This goes against all logic, but these folks never seem to throw overly well
  * Look for short points, more frequent Point-7-Outs than normal and the occasional run
  * Average Roll Count: 3-9, but it seems like these throwers are either always a 3 or always a 9
* How to play them
  * This group is best played with a short game approach
    * One or two box number hits and come down
  * Alternatively, a regression with a hedge will get you quickly playing with little risk
  * For the Don't bettor, this is a shooter to watch. If they lean on the lower side, pounce on the odds

**Rhythm Throwers**

* What to look for
  * Typically pick up the dice and toss them about the same way every time. 
  * Some of these rollers will "set" the dice with their favorite numbers
    * Doesn't mean they're a controlled shooter, just finding their zone
  * Soft tosses, with about the same height
  * Good soft landings in about the same spot, not a lot of noise.
  * Often, these folks throw "knuckeballs" \(no spin in the air\)
  * They're not at all dice controllers, but they're very consistent
* What to expect
  * This is still random
  * They tend to find a groove or get in the pocket more often than than pure random rollers
  * More box numbers than horn numbers
  * Average Roll Count: 5-7 
    * Here's where you'll find the people living more reliably at the average roll length
* How to play them
  * Almost any moderate growth strategy can work here
  * Great opportunity to do some regression, or a high first roll short game to fund a growth strategy
  * Playing a recycler or a builder works well \(hungry 6-8, etc\)
  * The ATS isn't a bad investment if they get into a good groove
  * They'll actually do well in the field. An Iron Cross might work well
  * For the Don't bettor, be careful here

**Decent and Good Dice Controllers**

* What to look for
  * Setting the dice quick
  * Consistent height, landing zone and action
  * Dice stick together in the air
  * Dice land flat \(no scattering\)
  * Dice hit the wall softly and bounce straight back and stop immediately
  * If you can see the set ...
    * Hardways: Look for no 6's or 1's ... this means they're "on axis"
    * 3V or Cross Sixes: If they're making numbers, they're GOOD. If they're in the horn, then they're falling off axis
  * They will at regular intervals call their bets off while they are still shooting
  * Average Roll Count: 7+
* What to expect
  * If a controlled shooter is on axis:
    * **They will reliably throw 7's less than the average**. 
    * They're also more likely to hit the box numbers in clusters.
    * You won't see a lot of horn numbers
* How to play them
  * Live in the box
  * You can probably plan to see more repeaters, so press a few times and collect high
  * You won't see many horn numbers, so the ATS may not be a great play
  * But repeater and fire bets might be a good buy
  * Be more aggressive early in the roll
  * Great chance for a high first bet, and then a big regress and press
  * Pay attention to them calling bets off
    * Chances are they know how long they typically go. If they're at "their number" and are pulling bets,  you should too.
  * Don't bettors might want go really light here

### How

As you adjust your style/strategy with the shooters, it's important to **stick to The Rule of 10s**.

While you may switch from playing an Iron Cross to a Don't Pass system ... stay with your alotted money per shooter, so that your bankroll is properly managed and your rack is under control. Remember that profits rule the day.
