### Why

Craps is a great game, but it’s easily ruined by either you not following the unwritten rules or allowing someone else to.

Its our job to keep it clean in real time, and educate so that the folks coming into the game get up to speed quickly

### What

There’s a bunch of videos out there that cover the unwritten rules, but here’s a few just to get the conversation started

* Don’t buy in or color up while a hand is active.
* Keep your bets out of the landing zone
* Keep yout hands out of the table when someone has the dice
* Bet in the right spot and don’t throw your chips around
* Don’t give darksiders attitude
* If you’re a dark sider, don’t be an ass and celebrate the seven or root for it

### How

See something, say something. But don’t be an ass. And definitely put an end to it. If we don’t police it, people will continue being idiots. 

Its perfectly acceptable to say things like

* “Wait until this roll is over”
* ”Hang on, he’s got the dice”
* ”Let the man throw”
* ”Keep your hands out of his way,  thats where he’s aiming”
* ”Lets get these out of the way” \(while moving your own chips\)

Set an example

* If you’re on the end, move your chips as far to the side as you can
* If you’re betting the field or come, put your chips out of the way
  * Tell the others to ”slide it over”

When someone does step out of line, be respectful, but fix it. If we spread the unwritten rules, especially to the noobs, they’ll keep spreading
