# Welcome to Pro Craps

Dedicated to playing Craps at a "Professional Level" ... not as a profession, but as a professional. We are highly focused on money management, discipline, practice, and honing our skills so that our time at the craps table is productive and hopefully more lucrative.

We'll certainly work in some strategy, as that's the nature of winning at this game, but our principal focus is on skill building and refinement so that while we're playing our strategies we can be on autopilot.

What you can expect from our channel?

Honest, opinionated (yet fact based) discussions and commentary on

* Bankroll and Money Management
* Discipline
* Practice planning and drills
* Learning how to play with purpose
* Tools and Tech that we use to get better
* Live strategy discussions and debates with our subscribers

Thanks in advance for subscribing and for using the comments section to provide feedback, ask questions, and of course, to call us out when you feel the need.

For all of our educational videos on strategy building and practice, the show notes and other information and resources can be found on the left. These are released roughly once a week or so, depending on our filming schedule.

‚òïÔ∏è **Coffee and Craps** is produced generally 3 times per week. We use this live stream to simulate a trip to a casino where we put our money and our strategies on the line to demonstrate money management, rail management, discipline, and working a strategy under pressure. This is done live and interactive with your comments.

ü•É **Cocktails and Craps** is generally live-streamed once per week, but not on a regular schedule. We use this time to break down strategies, tweak things, find holes and prep for future casino trips. Often, we'll run these episodes with other YouTubers or subscribers. Very fun and entertaining to debate and collaborate with folks in real time.

If you're interested in working with us on a strategy build live on an episode of Cocktails and Craps, please feel free to reach out to us we'll talk through the logistics.

## Podcast: Fireside Craps

Subscribe to our weekly podcast. We go places here that we don't on YouTube. Great conversations, stories, opinions and other stuff that doesn't make sense on a video, but should be a lot of fun in the car or while you're walking the dog.
