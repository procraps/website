# Goal: 7 Avoidance

### Why do we care so much about 7 avoidance?

Follow the math.

Every bet has a house edge built into it. The most basic are the pass/come. These bets have a 1.41% house edge built into them. This is based on a complex formula that is calculated by evaluating the number of ways to win the bet vs the number of ways to lose it.

If you can either

* Increase the probability of winning 
  * e.g. Make the 7 show up 13/72 instead of 12/72
* Decrease the probability of losing
  * e.g. Make the 7 show up 11/72 instead of 12/72 times

You can erase the edge the casino has and turn that to your advantage.

But that's a big \(very big\) "IF"

Imagine both of those scenarios on the come-out rolls and from the dark or light side. How would that impact your win percentage? The house edge?

What happens to probability if you can have an effect on the 7?

### What's involved in making this happen?

1. SRR & SOR are the primary metrics used
2. Die Theory
   1. How does a 7 happen?
3. Overspin and Opportunity

### How do Dice Controllers attack this problem?

1. Reduced energy into the wall
2. Reducing spin rates
3. Setting the dice
4. Trying to perfect some sort of controlled throw
   1. There are many types
   2. There are many obstacles to overcome
5. Logging and Adjusting
   1. Bone Tracker
   2. Craps Nation KPI Sheet
   3. Smart Craps \(GTC\)

### Is it possible?

1. There's an enormous number of things that have to go right on your end
2. The casinos have countermeasures in place to prevent you from doing the things that work
   1. Bouncy tables, Spiked walls, rules agains setting, rules forcing hard hits
3. This is climbing Mt Olympus blindfolded, with a broken leg, on crutches, in random weather
4. Stay Tuned ....
