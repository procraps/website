# Epic Randomness

An awful lot has to go right for a dice controller to get it done, and the casinos aren't making it easy

1. You cannot slide the dice \(they have to be airborne and bounce\)
   1. No 2 table surfaces are alike
   2. They are getting bouncier and bouncier so you cannot simply "learn" how to land
2. You have to hit the back wall
   1. It's got alligator skin / spikes to ensure randomness
   2. Some places actually force you to hit it hard
3. Some casinos have banned setting altogether. 

> It should be noted, that these measure would not be in place if it were not possible for humans to control the dice.

To overcome randomness, you need perfection. If you start with the assumption that you have a 100% chance to achieve perfection, then you can think about this issue by replacing perfection with bits of random, until there's nothing left. This is the argument against dice control.

Can you do all of these things, perfectly ... and still overcome the roadblocks we've already talked about?

1. Grip
2. Swing
3. Release
4. Launch Angle
5. Velocity
6. Landing Descent Angle
7. Landing Approach Angle
8. Landing Flat
9. Landing Distance
10. Number of rotations

Other than maybe the grip, every one of those has to be not only perfect, but different for every table and for every inch of distance and position/side you are at the table, even between throws.

### The Goal ...

It's an impossible task. Nobody is calling their shots. Remember the actual goal ... reliably make the 7 appear 5/36 times instead of 6.  The closer you get to eliminating the epic randomness, the closer you get to making the goal possible.

If the steps you take to achieve that goal result in clusters of numbers, that's a nice side benifet, and it potentially makes sense how that could happen, but this is all still random, and we can't forget that.
