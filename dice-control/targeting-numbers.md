# Goal: Targeting Numbers

### Sniping Numbers or Group Targeting?

99% of the dice controllers we've spoken to will tell you that they're not targeting a specific number, nor can they reliably hit it. The consensus is that based on the combination of the **dice set chosen**, and the **shot type** that they use, they expect results to:

* Favor Horn Numbers,  fail to the 7 and settle on a box $ for the come out rolls
* Avoid the 7 and establish a "pitch count" or expected roll length \(SOR\)
* Cluster box numbers 
* Produce "dominant" numbers
* Perhaps favor hard ways over easy numbers

**They will also all concede that every throw is random.** Their job is to try and lessen the degree to which things are random by eliminating some of the combinations through technique and physics.

Some quotes need to be shown here, from Cage, George, Toro, and Others, along with things said in the survey

"You can control everything up to the point at which they leave your hand"

"If you can keep them from dancing, they'll sit down for you, hopefully close to the way you let them go"

"A Controlled Shooter is a Shooter that tosses the dice MID-AIR ‚Äú On Axis‚Äù, with perfect pitch Control & after the dice make initial table contact \( before even kissing, tapping, Caressing, Making love to the backwall\) THAT beautiful, breath-taking toss is subject to randomness in EVERY form, shape, or fashion." \(Cage\)

"Once they hit the table, all you can hope for is that you've set them up to succeed"

"It's in God's hands once they hit the wall"

"Dice only stay ‚Äú On Axis‚Äù roughly 2-3% of the time after contact with the backwall, NO MATTER how expertly, or softly that you tap that backwall." \(Cage\)

"A set will only make your mechanics shine or hinder your result.  
Sets are a medium of expression of ones mechanics. Not the guarantee to a successful throw." \(George\)

"Yes there are other factors affecting the final result but if the toss and throwing form is solid it reduces tremendously the randomness. Therefore I whole heartedly agree the set plays a part. It's still part of the equation" \(Jim Spillane\)

"there is no on axis because its impossible for dice to be on axis all the way through the toss. On axis is straight line through both dice, so if either dice is not straight even a hair its already off axis.. But thats just my opinion üòÜ I can say I've never seen an on axis toss from anyone I've seen play its always skewed and by the time dice stop they've done multiple pitches. So my definition; I would say on axis is the perception one see's of starting set to resulting ending number, being one of the primary numbers of starting set." \(Arnel\)

"Dice have a way of humbling even the most experienced shooter." \(George\)

"Forget about the diamonds. Nowadays you have 7 rows and 5 rows of diamonds. You can‚Äôt exert control over them. Your control ends on landing the dice. It‚Äôs regained when the dice settle. And the result interpretation puts you in a position to adjust" \(George\)

"Control is regained when the result is interpreted by the shooter and the adjustment of set \(at its easiest level\) or grip and toss and release and landing zone \(at the highest level\) is adjusted for the next toss" \(George\)

"My definition is controlling the dice on the \( X,Y & Z\) axis from starting point to landing or impact. Theoretically this will make the dice land as close to the flat surface as possible, reducing the kinetic energy as they move towards the back wall on first bounce. After impact, if close together **should** rotate forward, kiss the back wall, re-land and settle." \(Toro\) ... emphasis on "Should"

### If you could do it ...

WinCraps examples \(simple and quick\)

Run both scenarios at standard distribution and with the 7 at 5, favoring the appropriate numbers and more-so the hard way versions of the even numbers

1. Outside with Hard Ways
2. Inside with Hard Ways

### How does a controller try and do it?

Reduce the amount of randomness by hiding some of the 36 combinations

* Dice Sets
  * Demonstrate a couple of them, focusing on how they target numbers and hide the 7
* Throw types \(need slow-motion of each in the air\)
  * Axis Throws
    * Parr Style \(Reverse spin\)
    * Foreward Spin
  * No Axis / Energy Management
    * Knuckleball 
    * Horizontal Spin

### Re-Defining the Terms

### Intentional Shooting

An intentional shooter is exactly that -- someone that throws with the intent of hitting a single number or a number within a small group of expected numbers.

#### Dice Control

Snipers. Someone claiming the title of "Dice Controller" is saying that they can exert control over the dice and generally pick numbers or clusters of numbers consistently and/or avoid certain numbers \(not just the 7\). Hits out of their expected grouping are considered to be a "mistake" and something that can be fixed or adjusted.

#### Dice Influence

An "Influencer" is similar, but are really targeting number groups from a set and primarily avoiding the 7. Theres a nuance here in that an influencer's approach is to put the dice into a configuration and throwing patterns that "should" have a good expected result -- they are giving themselves a chance to be in the expected group and to avoid the 7.

#### Controlled Shooter

The "Controlled Shooter" knows that in the end, the dice will be randomized by the table. But -- they make every attempt to control perfectly the things that they can: Set, Velocity, Landing Zone, etc. The theory here is that by repeating things consistently, you will find a pocket and have a better chance of a good result, reducing the amount of randomness by eliminating some possibilities. 

### So what's the problem?

#### The Table Fights Back

* 3 Points of Impact
  * Table
  * Diamonds
  * Table 
* Different surfaces, curves, lengths, rules

Show some slow motion showing the landings skittering and mayhem and leave that as a teaser for the epic randomness video

#### Controllers bet over their skill

Given the amount of randomness in every throw, over-betting is a huge issue
