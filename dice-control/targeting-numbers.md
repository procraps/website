### Random Shooting

These shooters have **no intent** of changing the outcome. They do throw it differently from one another, but the expected outcome is the same -- purely random

#### Rhythm Roller 

Throws the same way, every time. Rhythmic ... same swing, release, velocity, arc, landing area, etc. But has no expectations of that doing anything other than putting themselves into a groove.

#### Random Roller

There is some intent here, which is to ensure that the result is random. Throwing high, hard, low, slow, and all over the place, almos in an effort to hammer the rust off of the last roll. Again, though expecting a roll within normal probability
