# Goal: Targeting Numbers

### Re-Defining the Terms

### Intentional Shooting

An intentional shooter is exactly that -- someone that throws with the intent of hitting a single number or a number within a small group of expected numbers.

#### Dice Control

Snipers. Someone claiming the title of "Dice Controller" is saying that they can exert control over the dice and generally pick numbers or clusters of numbers consistently and/or avoid certain numbers \(not just the 7\). Hits out of their expected grouping are considered to be a "mistake" and something that can be fixed or adjusted.

#### Dice Influence

An "Influencer" is similar, but are really targeting number groups from a set and primarily avoiding the 7. Theres a nuance here in that an influencer's approach is to put the dice into a configuration and throwing pattersn that "should" have a good expected result -- they are giving themselves a chance to be in the expected group and to avoid the 7.

#### Controlled Shooter

The "Controlled Shooter" knows that in the end, the dice will be randomized by the table. But -- they make every attempt to control perfectly the things that they can: Set, Velocity, Landing Zone, etc. The theory here is that by repeating things consistenly, you will find a pocket and have a better chance of a good result, reducing the amount of randomness by eliminating some possibilities.

### Random Shooting

These shooters have **no intent** of changing the outcome. They do throw it differently from one another, but the expected outcome is the same -- purely random

#### Rhythm Roller 

Throws the same way, every time. Rhythmic ... same swing, release, velocity, arc, landing area, etc. But has no expectations of that doing anything other than putting themselves into a groove.

#### Random Roller

There is some intent here, which is to ensure that the result is random. Throwing high, hard, low, slow, and all over the place, almos in an effort to hammer the rust off of the last roll. Again, though expecting a roll within normal probability
