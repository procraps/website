# Getting to the Back Wall

What happens when we land?

1. Dropping the dice from .5", 1", ...
2. Flat
3. On Edge
4. Different surfaces
5. With momentum
6. With momentum and backspin / sidespin

How do we control that and get it to the wall under control?

1. Launch and decent angles
2. Some sort of spin
   1. Absorbs and disperses the energy
   2. Helps to land with the right faces up
3. Hit it straight on to reduce scatter
