# Overcoming Randomness

What happens when we land?

1. Dropping the dice from .5", 1", ...
2. Flat
3. On Edge
4. Different surfaces
5. With momentum
6. With momentum and backspin / sidespin

How do we control that and get it to the wall under control?

1. Launch and decent angles
2. Some sort of spin
   1. Absorbs and disperses the energy
   2. Helps to land with the right faces up
3. Hit it straight on to reduce scatter

Quotes

"Control is regained when the result is interpreted by the shooter and the adjustment of set (at its easiest level) or grip and toss and release and landing zone (at the highest level) is adjusted for the next toss" (George)

"My definition is controlling the dice on the ( X,Y & Z) axis from starting point to landing or impact. Theoretically this will make the dice land as close to the flat surface as possible, reducing the kinetic energy as they move towards the back wall on first bounce. After impact, if close together **should** rotate forward, kiss the back wall, re-land and settle." (Toro) ... emphasis on "Should"
