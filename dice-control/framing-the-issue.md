  Let's get 2 things straight ... Every roll is random. Humans can control the
  dice. Huh? Trust me.

# Framing the Issue

### Questions:

#### Correct Terminology

* Dice Controller
* Dice Influencer
* Controlled Shooter
* Experienced Shooter
* Rhythm Roller
* Random Roller

#### Is every throw random?

* Yes, of course
* But is this black and white?
* Are there degrees of random?
  * How does a dice controller try to overcome randomness?

#### What are dice controllers trying to control, exactly, and how?

> This is a great opportunity to share survey results \(70% want to avoid 7, 22% want to target \#s\)

* The 7
  * Prolonging rolls
  * Gaining an advantage over house edge
  * Changing the probabilities
* Targeting numbers specifically

#### Can the dice be controlled?

> Share some reddit, email, and youtube comments here. Unfortunately lots of negative stuff from this side of the argument.

#### The Case For 

* Physics are real
* Humans are capable of superhuman things
* Practice makes perfect
  * Look at Golf, Archery, Goalball
* The non-quantifyable argument: 
  * "If it wasn't real, there wouldn't be countermeasures"
  * And there are MANY countermeasures...

#### The Case Against 

> Share some images of people selling "never lose" systems

* The hardware -- table, back wall makes it actually impossible
* The time suck at the table
* Fantasy land
  * I've tried and failed and have given up on the fantasy
  * It's a unicorn, plain and simple
  * Snake oil salesmen

#### Can it be proven either way?

> Share the machine study and other folks that have tried

* Mechanical trials
* Lack of data
* Slow Motion
