# \*^ Throwing

### Why

Practice has to be focued and executed properly to make any sort of difference. Getting reps for the sake of getting reps is actually going to make you worse, as you’ll stagnate and lock in awful habits.

It’s also got to be enjoyable or you’ll never do it, so lets break down the things we need to get focus on, and some drills that’ll get us there.

### What

First, let’s call out the elements of a perfect, controlled throw in the order you execute them.

* Set
* Grip
* Swing
* Release
* Height
* Distance
* Accuracy

What we’re going to do, however, is work on the perfect throw in reverse, dialing in each aspect as we go.

What you’ll want to have:

* A throwing station
* A receiving station
* 36+ sets of quality dice, evenly distributed in 2 colors
  * i.e. 18 Red Sets, 18 Blue Sets

### How

#### Work in sets of 36, starting with perfect dice sets

We recommend doing your work in sets of 36, which is why you’ll want so many dice. As the first part in each of our throwing drills will start with the dice in hand, let’s setup every drill by setting our 20 sets.

Do this before every throwing drill:

*  Set every pair using the hardways set \(4-2, 4-2\)
  * We can easily track on/off axis throws and adjust
  * We can more easily see the rotation in the air
* Always make each set multi-colored
  * This will help you see which die is acting wrong and helps adjust
* Scramble the dice in piles separated by color
* Make 36 perfect sets , lined up, as fast as you can
  * Pick 2
  * Set them
  * Grip them using your grip of choice
  * Drop them in place
* Set a stopwatch and see how quickly you can do this.
  * You should average making 1 every 4 seconds
