# ^ Why, When, How to Practice

### Why

It may seem silly to practice something that is based on randomness. But there’s more here than just practicing dice setting and rolling

We want to play the entire game with precision.  Doing so means:

* Fewer Mistakes 
  * Mental: Strategy/Bet Decisions
  * Physical: Money Management, DIY Bets, Rolling
* Less Confusion for you and the dealers
* Better Pace
* Better decision making
* Less Stress
  * When you’re a machine, you don’t sweat the small stuff

### What

Not everyone has the room or money for a full home table ... what can you do?

#### 1. Betting Practice Rig

The most important thing is being able practice your strategies with live dice and chips. It’s not critical to have a full table. But having a way to lay out chips, roll random, and feel your strategy is a huge start.

* Get or build a small practice table. 
  * You can put together a personal sized fold-away betting table for about $200
* Get some dice
* Get a basic set of chips

#### 2. Throwing Practice Setup

If you’re into Dice Control, especially if you’re just getting started, you can take that practice table and make it a throwing station. 

* Add an armrest
* Buy or build a simple receiving station
  * A 6’ Table with a half layout with a backboard  is more than enough to receive on
  * Or ... use a pillow or couch. 
    *  Dice Control 101 is grip, release, flight, and distance ...
    * NOT the bounce or result
    * You can work on those things anywhere without a proper table to receive

### How

**Strategy Development and Practice**

* Spend about 30 minutes to an hour each day on your game
* Work your strategies 
* Log your results
* Use actual dice and chips and make all of your bet calls
  * It’s beneficial to see and feel your strategy live
* Re-Run your strategies using your roll logs
* Learn the payouts
* Practice your presses and money management
  * Memorize your press amounts \(when I win on the 5 with a $15 here's what I get and here's where it goes\)

**Dice Influence and Shooting**

* Whether or not you're into Dice Influence, you should practice your shot
* Get a rhythm, groove, comfort zone going. It'll increase your confidence and consistency
  * Setting
  * Grip, Release, Landing
  * 100 throws minimum per session
    * Assess and adjust
  * 3+ sessions per day

In addition, pick a strategy and ”roll a hand” every time you pass by your table

**4. Practice everywhere else:**

These are simple things you can do on your couch, while in an online meeting, or even in the car.

* Scramble and Re-Set the dice over and over
* Get your grip and put them back down
* Work on bet payouts and chip sorting
