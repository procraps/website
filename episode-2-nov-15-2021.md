# Episode 2 - Nov 15, 2021

### Story

Our story comes to courtesy of a listener. While I have so many good ones, I thought his would be great to share because it's so timely. Rick wrote me this email in response to our last podcast episode&#x20;

> We met some friends in Vegas last weekend and I was able to play at Ellis Island for the first time. $5 table with a very friendly/appreciative crew. I did well with the back wall come out lay and horseman. There was a couple of young beginners playing and asking me questions trying to learn about what I was doing. I was short and vague with my answers because I was trying to stay focused on my next move since it was a pretty choppy table and I was converting some of the come number hits to place bets. Afterward I realized how much of a douchebag I was by not being an ambassador of the game and giving these guys more of my time, they wanted to learn and I was more concerned with my play.

So ... it's good to know that someone was listening anyway. In all seriousness, though, the point we made last episode was a good one, and it's a challenge. Get out there and grow the game. At the real tables. Fight to keep the real tables accessible and drive the minimums down. Roll to Win has a place, but I'd sure rather see us pulling folks from that abomination and onto the real tables.

Save dealer jobs by giving them a place to work. Tip'm engage with them, and rock it. Oh, and just win, baby.

* Aiming for people's chips
* Trying to "take someones damn money" or "knock someone off"

Folks, we're all on the same team here ... the one that's trying to take money OUT OF THE CASINO, not each other's pockets. Be glad if anyone is doing that.
